      <h2 class="accent-text">-OUR PATH TO VICTORY-</h2>
      <p>The blueprint for Emperor Palpatine's rule is called the New Order. It is a fitting name for a system that has jettisoned the impracticalities and clutter of the Old Republic.</p><br />
      <p>The New Order is a direct respone to the Old Republic's failures, and a wise correction to it excuesses. Under the New Order, failed "everyone is right" democracies have been replaced by a clear structure, one that is both authoritarian and militaristic. Its tenets are upheld by the Commision for the Presercation of the New Order(COMPNOR).</p><br />
      <p>Under the Empire’s new order, our most cheriesed beliefs will be safeguareded. We will defend our ideals by force of arms. We will give no ground to our enimes and will stand toghter against attacks from withen and without. Let the enimes of the empire take heed: Those who challaenge Imperial Resolve will be crushed.</p><br />

      <p>We  are the first to go in. We face the enemy when they are strongest. We do not stop until we have achieved our objective. The Imperial Army walks in the path we blaze.<br><br>
We are independent, but we complete joint operations with other branches of the militay service. With the Imperal Navy, we serve aboard there warships and execute boarding operations against hostile vessels. With the imperal Army, we seize starports and take out gun emplacements.<br><br><br>
The Stormtrooper Corps is unconcerned with long-term occupation. We are deoployed when our Emperor requires our service and are recalled when he needs out elsewere.<br><br>

      <h1>Our History</h1><br><br>
      <hr><br><br>
     <p>
       The Stormtrooper Corps is unparalleled. Do not compre us to the feeble Judical Security forces that existed in the dying decades of the Republic. You must look back nearly 4000 years to the time of Republic rocket-jumpers to find an equivalent corps of elite, first-attack soldiers. Perhaps inspired by the military glories of the previous millennia, our wise Emperor authorized the deployment of millions of Kamino-grown clone troopers to put an end to the Separatist crisis.
    </p><br><br>
     <p>
     They outclassed there ostensible commanders, the Jedi Knights. Under the corrupt political system of the Republic, the clone troopers were forced to take orders from sword-carrying pacifists who had no business play-acting as military tacticians. When the Jedi showed their true colors with an assasination plot agains Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, it was the clone troopers who put down the Jedi uprising.
    </p><br><br>
     <p>
    From those elite, veteran clone troopers, the nucleus of the Emperor’s new Stormtrooper Corps was formed. Under this proud banner, they continued to fight against Separtist holdouts and radicals who resisted the New Order.
    </p><br><br>
     <p>
    Yes, the clone troopers had done their job, but it was a role they’d been bred for. Even more remarkable was the swell of young patriots who volunteered to follow thier example. As the Imperial military expanded, the Stormtrooper Corps diversified. Our Ranks soon included snowtroopers, sandtroopers, scout troopers and more. These brave men and women survied our training crucibles and proved themselves worthy of being called Imperial stormtroopers. Unified under a single cause, behind a common mask, each trooper makes a pledge.
    </p><br><br><br><br>
    <p class="accent-text"><i>I am a stormtrooper. My skin is my armor. My face is my helmet. My name is my number. I am fulfilled, for I am an agent of the Emperor.</i></p>

    <section class="background-medium">
      <h1>Training</h1><br><br>
      <hr><br><br>
      <p>Elite stormtrooper cadets carry out their training at the Academy of Carida. The facilities there produce superior stormtrooper officers. Those who survive their years at Cliffside on Cardia earn the right to lead their felllow stormtroopers.</p><br />
      <p>At Cardia, stormtrooper officer canidates undergo:</p><br />
      <ul class="list-style-circle">
        <li>Wilderness survial</li>
        <li>Desert warfare simulation</li>
        <li>Underwater battle tactics</li>
        <li>Experimental weapons testing</li>
        <li>Flash-memory instuction in military history</li>
        <li>Self-discipline through emotional suppression</li>
        <li>Education in the principles of the Emperor's New Order</li>
      </ul><br /><br />
      <p>The Empire's many victories against the forces of rebellion and chaos have inspired common Imperial citizens to ask how they may serve the Emperor. As a result of what they have witnessed on the Imperial NewsNets, may seek to wear polished white armor of the Stormtrooper Corps.</p><br/>
      <p>Only a few succeed. Most fail to meet posted physical requirments. Others wash out during training. Passing the merciles standards of the Stormtrooper Corps is a point of honor for those within our ranks, but the unfit need not despair. The Imperial Army and Navy need recruits too.</p><br/>
      <p>Imperial recruiters actively seek those who desire a career of service and are willin to die for a cause.</p><br/><br /><br />
